# Arda_Okan-VMG_Candidate_Project
Basketball object detection

Pre-requisites:
- Python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib
- cv2
- imutils

1) Download 'main.py' and 'vmg.py'.
2) Download the videos from Google drive.
3) Set the 'videoLoc' variable in Line 6 of 'main.py' to the location of one of the videos. (i.e. videoLoc = 'Set1/9964-10078.avi')
4) Run 'main.py'. Selected video will run and the ball will be detected by the program and enclosed with a red square.
   After the video runs, the x-y coordinates of the detected ball will be displayed in a figure.

More information about the algorithm can be seen in the report.
